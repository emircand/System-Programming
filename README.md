# System Programming Assignments

This repository contains a series of system-level programming assignments developed in **C** as part of a *System Programming* course. Each project demonstrates core concepts of low-level development, including process management, file I/O, multithreading, inter-process communication, and system call usage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts

- **Language**: C  
- **Platform**: Linux (tested on Ubuntu)  
- **Compiler**: GCC  
- **Core Concepts**:
  - Process creation and control (`fork()`, `exec()`, `wait()`)
  - Inter-process communication (`pipe()`, `shmget()`, `mmap()`, `mkfifo()`)
  - Socket programming (`bind()`, `accept()`, `connect()`)
  - Multithreading and synchronization (`pthread`, `mutex`)
  - Signal handling (`signal()`, `kill()`, `sigaction()`)
  - File operations and logging (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`, file locking)
